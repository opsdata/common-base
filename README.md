# common-base

Scheme, typing, encoding, decoding, and conversion packages for ELMT and ELMT-like API objects.

## Purpose

This library is a shared dependency for servers and clients to work with ELMT API infrastructure without direct
type dependencies. Its first consumer is `github.com/opsdata/elmt-sdk-go`.


## Compatibility

There are *NO compatibility guarantees* for this repository. It is in direct support of ELMT, so branches
will track ELMT and be compatible with that repo. As we more cleanly separate the layers, we will review the
compatibility guarantee.
